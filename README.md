## ⚙️ Vite + React Setup

This project uses `Vite` for fast build and development with React.

### Plugins Used:

- [`@vitejs/plugin-react`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react): Uses Babel for Fast Refresh

You can also opt for [`@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) for improved speed using SWC.

## ✅ ESLint Configuration

Basic ESLint rules are included for clean and consistent code.  
If you plan to scale this project, we recommend:

- Using **javaScript**
- Adding **type-aware lint rules**

For that, check out the [TypeScript + Vite template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io).
